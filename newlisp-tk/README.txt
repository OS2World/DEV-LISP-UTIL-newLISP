newLISP-tk v.1.36 for Linux, BSDx, Solaris, MacOS X and Win32
=============================================================



What is it?
===========

- newLISP-tk is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and frontend for newLISP.
- newLISP is a LISP like scripting language from http://newlisp.org

newLISP-tk was written in Tcl/Tk, which is a free and platform independent
toolkit for GUI applications. (see ww.scriptics.com). Using the newLISP-tk
frontend graphics capabilities, code browersers and editors are added to 
newLISP. newLISP-tk makes newLISP easier to use as an interactive LISP
environment. newLISP-tk communicates with the platform's Tcl/Tk installation
via Tcp/IP ports. See the newlisp-tk.html manual for details.

Installation and startup on Linux, BSDs, MacOS X and Solaris
============================================================

newlisp-tk is installed in /usr/bin/newlisp-tk during normal install
of newLISP. newLISP-tk also requires Tcl/Tk installed on your system,
which is standard on most Linux/UNIX installations and standard
on MacOS X 10.4/Tiger and later.

Installation and startup
========================

is not running by using the Windows Taskmanager and stopping the process if required,
