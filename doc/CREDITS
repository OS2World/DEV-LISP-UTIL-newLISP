Over the years many users have contributed to newLISP with, suggestions,
critiques and code. They where crucial in making newLISP what it is today.
I want to thank everybody and encourage them to continue
to contribute with code and comments. My special thanks go to
(in historical order):

Steve Adams 
  Did the first CYGWIN port and the new native Win32 ports, suggested many
  other features and functions found today in newLISP.

Stellan Borg 
  Some of the string functions where suggested by him, discovered and
  prompted the fixing of many shortcomings in newLISP, built first
  commercial product (the knowledge manager SUCCEED tm) based on newLISP.

Lars Hard
  Many insights and ideas (where are you?, I want to contact you).

Ryon Root
  Set up and maintains the web board for discussing newLISP at
  http://www.alh.net/newlisp/phpbb/index.php .

Eddie Rucker
  His comments, insights and ideas have prompted many changes and additions
  since the Unix versions of newLISP have appeared in 2001.

Hans Peter Wickern
  Many usability suggestions and newlisp-tk.tcl improvements. Hans-Peter
  also introduced newLISP to many NeoBook and PowerBasic users and has
  written various DLLs which can be imported by newLISP on the Win32
  platform http://hpwickern.bei.t-online.de/anmeldung/html1/newLISP/newLISP.html.

Nigel Brown
  Helped making floating point behaviour consistent across platforms, 
  researched the use of setlocale(), triggered bugfixes and changes in
  math functions and contributed many other suggestions, which
  helped to improve newLISP.

Keith Trenton
  Helps initiated the documentation thread on the discussion board, since
  then many useres have pointed out errors in the documentation and
  suggested improvements.

Samuel CoX
  Pointed out many flaws in the documentation , prompted addition of atan2
  and contributed code examples.

Brian Clausing
  did the first complete pass through the manual taking care not only of
  spelling and punctuation but also improving style.

Norman Deppenbroek and Peter van Eerten, http://gtk-server.org
  both from the GTK-server project helped improving networking functions.
  Peter's GTK-server is an alternative to Tcl/Tk when doing platform
  independent GUIs or graphics with newLISP.
  Norman has contributed many useful newISP command line utilities
  for the Internet and other usages http://www.nodep.nl/newlisp/.  

David S. de Lis from http://www.geocities.com/excaliborus/
  contributed the newlisp.vim file for VIM editor syntax highlighting
  now part of the newLISP source distribution

Luis Carvalho (Kozure) ported newLISP to the PocketPC running Win CE
  using Alexander Mamaich's pocket gcc, a port of gcc for ARM cpu based
  PocketPC, http://mamaich.kasone.com/fr_pocket.htm.

John Small
  initiated the advancement of logical programming in newLISP and contributed
  many scripts showing how to use newLISP macros. He also wrote the popular
  introduction "newLISP in 21 minutes"

Greg Ben
  contributed an account and space on a Sun Sparc workstation for better
  development and testing on the Sun Solaris platform.

Lucas Wix
  developed the first newlisp.jsf syntax file for the Joe editor
  now part of the newLISP source distribution

Tim Johnson
  developed a syntax file for Emacs http://www.johnsons-web.com/demo/newlisp/ 

John DeSanto, Gordon Fischer, John Flowers, Martin Quiroga (alphabetical order)
  from Kozoru.com for their ideas and suggestions for improvements and enhancements
  of the newLISP language and improvements and work-out of the database libraries
  sqlite.lsp (Flowers) and mysql.lsp (Fischer). In June 2006 Kozoru released
  http://byoms.com, a distributed application almost entirely built with newLISP. 

Cormullion cormullion@mac.com, http://newlisper.blogspot.com
  for evangelizing newLISP on the MacOS X platform and publishing many ideas
  how to use newLISP on that platform and writing the "Introduction to newLISP"

Michael and Melissa Michaels, http://newlisper.blogspot.com
  for a complete review of the Users Manual and evangelizing efforts for newLISP
  and other good ideas, i.e. defaults in argument lists: (define (foo x (y 1)) ...) 

Bob Bae (aka frontera000, http://sparebandwidth.blogspot.com/)
  bringing many ideas to the advancement of newLISP and actively advocating for
  newLISP on his and other peoples blogs

Jeremy Dunn
  introduced the idea of default args for several operators i.e. (> x) => (> x 0)
  and for (>> x) => (>> x 1), (div x) => (div 1 x) ... and suggestions

------------------------- other contributors, sources ----------------------------
Phillip Hazel
  wrote the PCRE (Perl Regular Expressions) library, it is an essential
  part of newLISP and many other scripting languages and Open Source applications
  (i.e. Apache)

Jorge Acereda and Peter O'Gorman
  wrote dyna link library functions for OSX which are used in this project,
  their files osx-dlfcn.c/.h are necessary on pre 10.3 versions of MacOSX
  (functionality/code? now part of OX X since 10.3)

Daniel Stenberg
  from the cURL project newLISP adapted the base64 encoding and decoding routines

Thomas Niemannn
  wrote a red-black binary tree algorithm used in newLISP with modifications

Sourceforge.net
  Has helped newLISP and many other Open Source projects to get more visibility,
  the newLISP project enjoys their compile farm to port newLISP to other platforms

Richard M. Stallman
  GCC and other GNU - tools make it possible today to write platform independent
  software for many OSs and hardware platforms and are together with the GPL 
  a strong force in the open source movement from which newLISP has benefitted.


My apologies to anybody, who was forgotten on this list (let me know).
